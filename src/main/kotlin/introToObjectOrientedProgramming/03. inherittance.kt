/*
* Overriding member functions and properties in Kotlin
* If a function or property with the same name exist in the child class then we need to override the them
* in child class using override keyword.
*
* Overriding member function
* A child class can override the member function of parent class using override keyword.
* By overriding a function, a child class gives its own implementation to the already existing code of base class.
* Overriding doesnâ€™t mean that it will update the code in base class, the change is only applicable to
* the class overriding the function or its sub classes. .
